# MultiCloud DB Replication

# Description

Note : First, delete CloudSQL using the `cdktf destroy` command. An error will occur during this process, so you must delete the VPC peering record in the VPC peering network before running `cdktf destroy`.
â€» There are dependencies involved, and I believe this is the cause, but the solution is unknown.
